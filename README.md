# sgCarMart Web Scraping and Exploratory Data Analysis Project

This is a mini-project that encompasses bulk of the data science process — from data collection, data cleaning, up to the exploratory data analysis stage.

**About sgCarMart**
sgCarMart is Singapore’s largest used car marketplace. According to its website, it sells 79% of all used cars in Singapore, has 2.6 million visitors and 40 million views monthly, and leads the market with more than 95% of online classified cars traffic in Singapore.

**Purpose of Project**
With the prohibitive cost of car ownership in mind, analysis of data from the used car market may potentially offer savings and gains for sgCarMart, the consumer and car dealers. sgCarMart boasts a database of more than 100,000 vehicles, and does not seem to have an analytics or data science team dissecting the data. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis to derive meaningful insights for sgCarMart, consumers and dealers.
